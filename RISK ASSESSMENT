**Risk assessment** is a systematic process used to identify, analyze, and evaluate potential risks that could impact a project, organization, or community. Hereâ€™s a brief overview:

1. **Identification:** Determine what risks might affect the entity, such as natural disasters, operational failures, or security breaches.

2. **Analysis:** Assess the likelihood and impact of each risk to understand its potential effects.

3. **Evaluation:** Prioritize risks based on their severity and probability, deciding which risks require immediate attention or mitigation.

4. **Mitigation:** Develop strategies and actions to manage or reduce the identified risks to acceptable levels.

Risk assessment helps organizations anticipate and prepare for potential problems, minimizing their impact and ensuring better preparedness and response.
